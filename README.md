1. What is `Flutter`?

   `Flutter is Google's UI toolkit for crafting beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.`

2. What are the `different types of widgets in Flutter`?

   Two types of widgets present in the Flutter are stateless and stateful. 

   The stateless widgets don’t store any values which will change in the future. 
   The stateless widgets don’t store any state. Icon, text widgets are some examples of stateless widgets.

   The stateful widgets have a state object to keep track of all the changes and updates happening in the UI. 
   These widgets are immutable but the state object is used to keep track of the changes. 
   Checkbox and image are some of the examples of stateful widgets.

3. Difference b/w `Stateful` widget and `Stateless` widget.
   
   Stateless widgets cannot change their state during the runtime of the app, 
   which means the widgets cannot be redrawn while the app is in action. 

   Stateful Widgets are the ones that change its properties during run-time. 
   They are dynamic i.e., they are mutable and can be drawn multiple times within its lifetime. 
   

4. What is the use of `pubspec.yaml` file in `Flutter`?

   The pubspec. yaml file is the most important file in any Flutter project. 
   It is the place where you provide all the required dependencies of your Flutter project.
